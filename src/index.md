This is the homepage.

Maybe 4-5 latest posts.

Recent "how to" tagged content?

Show links to concepts such as:

languages:
- liquidjs
- nunjucks
- JavaScript (.11ty.js)

Other core concepts such as:
- filters
- plugins
- shortcodes
- transforms

Not sure if this is an indication that content should be destructured further, such as:

- /lang/liquidjs/
- /core/filters/

Keeps the top level cleaner, at the expense of deeper nesting.
