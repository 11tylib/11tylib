List of official plugins with links.

Might be able to use npms.io API for plugins w/ "@11ty" namespace. If we can get their package.json data (possibly returned directly from npms.io) then we can probably display the name+version, description, and link to their respective GitHub repos.

Link to [./community/](community/) plugins page.

Link to official docs on writing your own custom plugins.
